HTTP Request / Response:-
Communication between clients and servers is done by request and response.
● A client (browser) sends an HTTP request to the web.
● A web server receives the request.
● The server runs an application to process the request.
● The server returns an HTTP response to the browsers.
● The client (browser) receives the response.

What is a Module in Node.js?
Consider modules to be the same javascript libraries. A set of functions you
want to include in your application.
Each module in Node.js has its own scope, meaning the variables, functions,
and other declarations inside a module are not accessible from outside unless
explicitly exported.
Node.js provides a set of built-in modules that offer commonly used
functionality. These modules are available without requiring any additional
installation and can be accessed using the require() function. Examples:
include the http module for creating HTTP servers, the fs module for file
system operations, and the path module for working with file paths.
